[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/wix/zone.png)](http://travis-ci.org/wix/zone)

Description
===========

Lightweight resource and provider to manage Solaris zones.


Solaris, OpenCSW pkgutil already installed.


Configures, installs and boots Solaris zones.

Only a limited sub-set of configuration options are supported.

If the configuration of a running zone is changed, the zone must be rebooted for the changes to take effect.

New in version 0.0.2:

* /etc/sysidcfg is now created by default from a template.  Turn this off by setting use_sysidcfg to false.
* If copy_sshd_config is true (default), /etc/ssh/sshd_config is copied from the global zone to the new zone.

New in version 0.0.4:

* You can now re-configure options after a zone is setup.
* More options are supported.

Requirements
============

Solaris, zonecfg, zoneadm.
